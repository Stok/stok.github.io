My first software development projects revolved around controlling physics experiments, acquiring data and analysing it; stuff you need to do as an experimental physicist. Over time, I really got into it. I started branching out and trying things that are unrelated to my day job. Unlike bulky and expensive physics experiments, it's really exciting to be able try stuff with my little laptop while sitting on the couch! The variety of tools, libraries, programming languages etc. seem endless. I discovered I have access to far more toys than I'll ever have time to play with.

Most of this blog is written from the standpoint of 'someone who just figured out how to do X', rather than in the more common 'step-by-step tutorial from some expert' style. That's partly because that's exactly what this is, and partly because there are many tutorials on most of these subjects already (many thanks to the people who made those). I did try to highlight pitfalls that I got stuck on though. 

I'm hoping that this can be of some use to someone thinking about getting into programming as a hobby. There are a million 'one-person' projects out there that don't seem too difficult and are good fun to tinker around with.

So, thanks for stopping by and good luck!
