I'm Sean. I am a scientist. I work on producing cold, gas-phase molecular samples and making very precise measurements on them in order to test fundamental physics.

A few years ago, I tested whether the strength of electromagnetic interactions vary within the Milky Way. "Standard" physics says it shouldn't. If it does (even a little bit), something weird is going on. In order to do this, we took some data (spectroscopy) in the lab, and compared it to data from telescopes. You can find the paper [here](http://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms3600), and a very nice recent Scientific American article about related work on looking for variations of fundamental constants [here](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/are-the-constants-of-physics-constant/).

Since then, I've been working on trying to observe parity violation in chiral molecules. In physics, an object and its mirror image usually behave in the same way (same internal energy, same almost anything else you can think of apart from its geometry). But the weak-force (one of the 4 fundamental forces) breaks this rule, favouring one handedness over the other. The result of this has been observed in particle physics and in atoms, but never in molecules. Some even say that this may have something to do with the origin of life (A rather long-winded article on this can be found [here](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10698-009-9070-0), and an old Scientific American article about it [here](http://quantummechanics.ucsd.edu/ph87/ScientificAmerican/Sciam/Hegstrom_The_Handedness_of_the_universe.pdf)).
