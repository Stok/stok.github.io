This might be necessary if, for instance, you're trying to visualise your 'github pages' site locally. Assuming you've installed [brew], get [ruby]:
```
brew install ruby
```

Once you have ruby, use its package manager called gem to install [jekyll]:

```
gem install jekyll
```

You can then run the site at its root directory:
```
jekyll serve
```
