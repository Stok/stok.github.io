I started [this blog] because of my growing interest in computers.

For the work I do as a an experimental physicist, see either:

1. The [website of the research group I belong to at the university] (mostly only available in french, regretfully)

2. One of my profiles on [ResearchGate], [LinkedIn] and [Google Scholar]
